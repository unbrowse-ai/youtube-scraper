# YouTube scraper

## When to use
- "Top YouTube videos for X with view counts", "how many likes does this video have", "collect the videos about X with durations and dates".
- Not for transcripts, comments or full channel uploads (not covered).

## Run
Uses `UNBROWSE_API_KEY` when set (free at https://unbrowse.ai); without it, requests go straight to the site. From the repo root:

```bash
node index.mjs "<search terms>" --max 20 > out.json            # search cards
node index.mjs "<search terms>" --max 10 --details > out.json  # + likes, comments, tags
node index.mjs "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>" > out.json
```

Options: `--max N` (≤ ~20, one results page), `--details`, `--shorts`.
Progress goes to stderr, the JSON array to stdout. Exit 1 on error, 2 on zero results.

## Output
Array of videos. Search: `id, url, title, channelName, channelId, viewCount, publishedTimeText, duration, durationSeconds, description, thumbnailUrl, position, searchQuery, scrapedAt`.
Video page (and `--details`) adds: `likes, commentsCount, publishedAt, uploadedAt, category, keywords[], isLive, isFamilySafe, channelUrl, channelSubscribers, playability`.
