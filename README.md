# YouTube Scraper (Node.js): search results and video stats as JSON

Scrape YouTube search results and video pages into JSON: title, channel, channel id, view count, likes, comment count, duration in seconds, publish date, category, tags, full description, subscriber count and thumbnail. No YouTube Data API quota, no Google Cloud project, no OAuth consent screen: the scraper reads the public pages and takes the data YouTube embeds in them.

Each page is requested from your own machine through a public [Unbrowse](https://unbrowse.ai) tool and parsed locally, so the numbers are exactly what YouTube served.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unbrowse-ai/youtube-scraper && cd youtube-scraper && npm install
export UNBROWSE_API_KEY=ub_live_...        # free key: https://unbrowse.ai

node index.mjs "lofi hip hop" > lofi.json
node index.mjs "home espresso review" --max 10 --details > espresso.json
node index.mjs "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" > video.json
```

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `<input>...` | | Search terms, a video URL (watch, youtu.be, shorts) or an 11-character video id |
| `--max N` | 20 | Videos per search (the first results page holds about 20) |
| `--details` | off | Read each video page too: likes, comment count, tags, full description |
| `--shorts` | off | Keep Shorts in search results |

From code:

```js
import { scrapeSearch, scrapeVideo } from "./index.mjs";
const results = await scrapeSearch("rust async tutorial", { max: 10, details: true });
const video = await scrapeVideo("dQw4w9WgXcQ");
```

## Output

With `--details` (description shortened):

## FAQ

**Why only about 20 results per search?** Further results load through a YouTube API call the public page tool does not cover. Use more specific queries, or several.

**Why a key?** Pages are fetched through Unbrowse's public `youtube.com` tool, which tells your machine what to request. The key is free; the request leaves from your IP.

**YouTube asked to "confirm you're not a bot".** The scraper closes the session without reporting the page and throws `RefusedError`. Wait, or use another network.

**Transcripts, comments, channels?** Not in this scraper yet. Contributions welcome: see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/unbrowse-ai/open-scrapers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
